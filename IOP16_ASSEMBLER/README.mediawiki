== IOP16 Assembler ==

* The CPU has an Assembler
* The Assembler is written in Python 3
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/IOP16/blob/main/IOP16_ASSEMBLER/pyAssemble_cpu_001.py Python code is located here]
* There's also a Windows executable if you don't have Python 3 installed on your computer
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/IOP16/tree/main/IOP16_ASSEMBLER/dist Executable located here]

== Assembler - Windows executable ==

* Windows executable is [https://github.com/douggilliland/Design_A_CPU/tree/main/Assembler/dist in this folder]
* Useful for people who don't have Python 3 installed
* Compiled to executable using
<pre>
pyinstaller --onefile pyAssemble_cpu_001.py
</pre>

== Files ==

=== Input fileName.csv ===

* Input file is tightly constrained in CSV file
** Input File Header has to be

<pre>
['LABEL', 'OPCODE', 'REG_LABEL', 'OFFSET_ADDR', 'COMMENT']
</pre>

=== Memory Map File ===

* Optional File named: fileName_MMAP.csv
** Memory map file Header has to be

<pre>
#	['IO_ADDR','DIR','MNEUMONIC']
</pre>
* IO_ADDR = 0XNN
* DIR = R, W, or RW
** Ex: ['0X00','R','LED_RD']

=== Constants file ===

* Optional File named: fileName_CONST.csv
* Constants file Header has to be -
<pre>
['LABEL','STRING']
</pre>

== Output files ==

* .mif file - Quartus II ROM Memory Initialization File
* .lst file - Listing file (with addresses)

== Assembler Psuedo-opcodes ==

* NOP - No operation
* HLT - Halt (Jump to self)
* BEQ - Branch if equal (same as BEZ)
* BNE - Branch if not equal (Aame as BNZ)

== Error Messages ==

* Error messages are pretty rudimentary.
* Dialog box notes that error messages are printed to the command window.
* The line with the error is printed as a list of the line.
* Missing labels are presented as a message.
* Only one error at a time is presented.
